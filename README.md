# Issue Board

![board](../assets/../docs/docs/board.png)

Your first step is to check the [issue board](https://gitlab.com/carelyo/docs/-/boards/3741305) 

This is where you will find and track all issues related to updating documentations for the features you are working on. 

If the issue you are working on is not here. Create a
new issue in the backlog add the `Docs` label to it. Issues that you begin with are directly added on the `In Progress` List.

Issues that you are not working on yet are added on todo if you plan to work on them soon or the backlog when they have
lower priority. 

No more than 6 issues can be on `Todo` at any given time so if the `Todo` is full pick a task from there
first and write your new task to the backlog.


## Markdown Features

Documentation is one of your product's interfaces with your users. A well-written and well-organized set of docs helps
your users understand your product quickly. Our aligned goal here is to help your users find and understand the
information they need, as quickly as possible.

Docusaurus 2 uses modern tooling to help you compose your interactive documentation with ease. You may embed React
components, or build live coding blocks where users may play with the code on the spot. [*Read
