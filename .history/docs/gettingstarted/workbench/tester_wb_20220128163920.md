# Carelyo Tester Workbench

> Tester Workbench

## Introduction

Carelyo is a complex website and automated testing are done to ensure that any change in code donot break the behaviour of the whole website.  

## Type of test

In the test folder you will find :  

### Unit Tests for backend code

[Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) is used for unit testing. Each class will have a test file. Test file will be in the test folder. And test folder will be found in the same directory where the main folder exists.

### Unit Tests for frontend code

## Creating your own unit tests

Unit tests are great if you want to validate the behavior of a single unit of code. By “unit of code” we usually mean a class although it could also be a script.

Creating a test file : Everything is explained in the [Junit5](https://junit.org/junit5/) documentation.

```bash
package com.carelyo.backend

import com.carelyo.backend
import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
import org.mockito.Mockito;

class abcTest {

  @BeforeEach
   void setUp() {

   }

   @Test
   void aTest {

   }

   @Test
   void bTest {
     
   }
}

```

[Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) is used to mock the database for testing.
