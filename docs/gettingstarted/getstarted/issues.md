### How to create a Main Task

5. Give a short description with bullet points max 3 points
6. Assignee i.e., Yourself
7. Due Date 
8. Milestion (MVP)
9. Label (Backlog)
10. Create issue

### Create a branch for the Main Task
In the project that you are working on i.e., [doctorui](https://gitlab.com/carelyo/frontend-team/doctorui2.0/-/branches) click New branch
Naming convention: branchname = issuenumber + taskname (#134 Make sure no content is outsid the completeProfile_card)


## Sub Task
This a task or tasks that are linked to a Main Task

### How to create a Sub Task
1. Find the Main Task and click it. You can find it by going to the Project => Issues => List => search the issue
