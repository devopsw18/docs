# Commiting Changes

When writing a commit message make sure it:

1. Contains enough information
2. Prefix Your commit message with

  - Added for new documents
  - Changed for changes in present documents
  - Removed if you removed a document
  - fixed when you fix a document eg. typos, style and so on

3. Add Appropiate label to your merges and issues
4. Use keywords to automatically close your issue

:::caution Dont do one massive commit with lots of changes we will not merge such commits so do small and detailed
commits that are related to an issue if no issue exist create one
:::

5. You can commit changes to [Develop Branch](https://gitlab.com/carelyo/docs/-/tree/develop/docs) or create your own "
  feature" branch then merge to develop
