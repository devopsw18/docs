Steps followed for manual testing(Front-end)


1.The first step is to clone the project from gitlab.

2.We need to create a .env file in the project.

2.After that we need to bring the latest changes made by the front-end developer to our individual systems ,for that we fetch the latest changes by the command “git fetch --all” then “git pull”.

3.Then we run “npm install” to install node.

4.Then we run “npm start” on all the projects where there is no next.js file.

5.We run “npm run dev” on the projects with next.js file.

6.This will lead us to the localhost page for the respective project.

7.Currently we are focusing on Doctor ui, so doctor’s dashboard, bookings etc. we are testing.

8.We try to understand what the test case is asking for(what the functionality does).

9.We check if the actual result  matches with the expected result.

10.If it matches the test passes.

11. If there are questions about how to understand the issue we contact frontend developer (assignee) and invite to testers discord group to explain
