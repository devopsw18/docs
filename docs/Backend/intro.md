# Intro

### API List

Here the backend engineer will expose all Apis that the frontend engineer needs without them having to go to the backend to find it themselves. This saves time and makes us more productive.

As you test your Api's on Postman just update your working Api's here.

Also, Frontend engineers should indicate missing Apis too.

Request dto field with ~~strikethrough~~ means the field is in dto but it can be null and will not effect for the method.

Request dto field with question mark? means the field can be null and it will effect when it has value.
